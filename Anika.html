            The Problem
        </h2>

        <p>
            Gifts are difficult to choose. The choice between two gifts has been experienced at least once in life.
            <br>
            From toys to cars, it's never easy to choose what the other person might like.
            <br>
            The gift being unimpressive or disappointing for the recipient is a thought in any gift-giver's mind.
        </p>

            About The Creators
        </h2>

        <p>
            We met in college in 2020 and all we thought of a idea to help people who have a hard time thinking of gift
            ideas
            <br>
            for their loved ones. Few months later, Simply Gifts was born. The first catalogs had items from a small
            clothing store
            <br>
            also grew bigger with our increasing number of employees sponsor and in 2023 we have deals with Amazon,
            <br>
            Macyâ€™s, and Target. Originally, we had funding from Amazon, helping our company to grow and flourish.
        </p>

        <h2>
            How this helps
        </h2>

        <p>
            You might be asking: "Who's actually using this?". A lot of people actually.
            <br>
            60% of 2000 interviewed americans felt that they struggle when finding the proper gift
            <br>
            If we apply this percentage to the total american population, it means about 200540312 struggle to finds
            gifts in America alone.
            <br>
            By making this app, we can help these people feel confident about gift-giving and give the best present
            possible for loved ones
